title: POSSCON 2012 Day 2 and Afterthoughts
---

Well, Thursday was the closing day of POSSCON.  What can I say?  It was awesome sauce!  Great speakers, good times.  Scott McNeely's talk was good and full of perspective.  Don't agree with him on two topics: php and software patents...but I am more of a NGO type (if you were there, you'll get it!)\nThe BOF Lunch was good times too.  We had some good interest in the PHP users group.  
Bottom line: Can't wait until next year!
