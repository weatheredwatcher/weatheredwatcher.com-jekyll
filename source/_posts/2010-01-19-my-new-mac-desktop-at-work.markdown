title: My new Mac Desktop (at work)
---

\n    I got a new mac at my job.  I opted for a Mac Mini, fully upgraded to 4gigs of ram and a single 500gb harddrive.  I also got two 20" HD LCD monitors.  It's a sweet deal.  Here is a side-by-side screen shot of both on the desktop.

Since I use the machine mainly for web-development, I have a slew of browsers installed, including IE8 via Windows 7, Bootcamp and Parallels.  I created aliases for each browser and placed them in a stack on the dock for easy access

Another thing I like to do is use the Secret plugin to hide the desktop and then load the desktop via  a stack on the dock as well.
