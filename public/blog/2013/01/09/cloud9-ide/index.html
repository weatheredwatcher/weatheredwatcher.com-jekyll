<p>A few days ago I went ahead and I install Cloud9 ide onto my laptop.  I&rsquo;ve been using the cloud version for editing this site as well as some other git-hub based sites and I love it.  I didn&rsquo;t think that I could love it even more then I did before, but I do!\n Locally, I can launch a workspace and start editing local files&hellip;and the console gives me complete shell access to my system!  I&rsquo;m working on a project that is being managed with subversion =( and the design team is using sass.  So when a change is made in the core style, I can go to the console and update the svn then compile sass with compass  and we are good to go!!
 Obviously I also use it with all my projects that are git based as well!!  It&rsquo;s very nice.  It&rsquo;s also very helpful with my New Years Resolution to learn Node.  Cloud9 is node based and gives a GREAT environment to develop node in.  Also, when I am using a single screen of the laptop, it&rsquo;s a great space saver.  C9 loads up in Chrome right next to the site I am working on.  I have all the Dev tools handy and can just go back and forth between the tabs!!
So go ahead and give it a try!  You can install it as easy as pie&hellip;look into the git hub repo: <a href="https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9!!">https://github.com/ajaxorg/cloud9!!</a></p>
