<p>\n    Lately I have been working like I don&rsquo;t know what! It&rsquo;s been crazy. But, I have a few minutes to spare and thought that I&rsquo;d write another post.
Komodo crashed on my so much that I have deemed it a lost cause. I have had similar luck on the post Oracle Netbeans builds.. so I have switched to Eclipse for my IDE needs. Emacs still rocks, but if I need a little bit more power, I have Eclipse. I use it with the Aptana and RadRails plugins. So, it makes a great html editor&hellip;.but I still prefer emacs for rails work.
Over the weekend I installed Debian Squeeze. It is the first totally free kernel. No non-free drivers or modules. I like.
Here is a cool screenshot:

Anyway.  Good times.  What else is going on right now?  Finishing up one hell of a project.  Not hard my nature&hellip;hard by the folks I have to deal with.  I have another major contract coming up (but can&rsquo;t say too much about it yet) and I am preparing for my session and workshop at POSSCON. It&rsquo;s getting closer! If you are not signed up yet, you should! I&rsquo;ll be giving a talk on using OSS to help run your business on the cheap. My workshop will be a great time where we go over how to use most of the software that I talk about in my session. This is my first time talking a major conference and I am excited about it!
Well, that&rsquo;s all for right now. I&rsquo;ll try and have some cool stuff for you all soon!</p>
