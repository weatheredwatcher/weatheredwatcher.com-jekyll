<p>\n    Recently, I&rsquo;ve been working on a project remotly that needs me to keep the rest of the team up to date. So we started by using a shared Dropbox folder. When you don&rsquo;t need serious versioning, this is the way to go! I use the Dropbox Shared Folder for developing and whatever I do is automatically synced. And the rest of the team knows. To take this a step higher, use the Public folder. As long as you are only messing with HTML and JavaScript, you can get real live previews of what you are working on, on a real server (&lsquo;cause some stuffin js dosen&rsquo;t work properly simply out of the Dropbox folder). Of course, if you need serious versioning control, you can use github and Cloud9ide. Cloud9ide is essentially what happen to Mozilla&rsquo;s Bespin project. It&rsquo;s a great way to code and collaborate in the cloud.
Recently, I&rsquo;ve been giving Komodo Edit and Komodo IDE a run. Honestly, the full IDE is so NOT worth the$300+ price tag they put on it. At least not on a Linux/Unix environment where we have so many great command line tools&hellip;:)
But honestly, I really like Komodo Edit. It reminds me a lot of Coda for the Mac (albeit not as pretty!) Plus, they have a Open Source project now with the base Source of Komodo Edit. It looks like a promising project for a much needed area of Development in Linux. (At least imho). I can&rsquo;t stand running shit on the JVM! Netbeans (which I didn&rsquo;t mind using) seems to have gone to hell since Oracle took over. Once I&rsquo;ve used it a little bit longer, I&rsquo;ll give it a good one over review. For now, I gotta go. Deadlines, deadlines and more deadline!</p>
