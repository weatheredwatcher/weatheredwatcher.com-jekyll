<p>\n    Ok, so here is a return to my absolutly favorite language&hellip;ruby. This is a modification of my js Factory Method. It&rsquo;s a good little bit of code. I decided to make it a bit of useful code. I am waiting for keyboard input. A B and C will create pizzas and Q will end the program</p>

<p>The first part of this code is actually identical to the implementation of a Strategy Method.  It is the addition of the case statement that helps turn it into a Factory Method</p>
