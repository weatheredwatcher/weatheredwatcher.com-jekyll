<p>\n    I am redesigning my site now. It&rsquo;s gonna have a brand new look as well as be rewritten in Rails 3. The blog will still be posted through Posterous. But I&rsquo;m working to make it even more transparent than it is now. Also, I am working on a slightly more professional look for it all. Not so much black! Also working on a Rails Picasa Web plugin. Keep your eyes peeled for updates!
In other news, I am waiting on a Thinkpad t60 to arrive..my hackintosh! Also, getting ready to get back into iPhone development. Trying to find someone to buy or trade my Sony Ericson Xperia x10a so I can get at least a 3GS. I really am not all that fond of Android. I have already reverted back to my old iPhone whilst I wait for a new one. But, more on that later. Needs an entire post on that and I really need to sit down and articulate my dislike before I do that. :)</p>
