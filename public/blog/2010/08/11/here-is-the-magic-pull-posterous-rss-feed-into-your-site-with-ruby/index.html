<p>\n    I know it&rsquo;s been a bit since I&rsquo;ve posted. I&rsquo;ve been busy! I&rsquo;ve decided to go ahead and post a gist of the ruby code that I used to get my Posterous feed on my blog. First you need to put this in your controller for the the page where you want the rss feed to display.</p>

<p> After this all that you need to do is include @contentArray in your view and all is done. I love how simple Ruby is!!</p>
