<p>\n    I can&rsquo;t really remember how long I have been following the blog of <a href="http://noone.org/blog">Axel Beckart</a>but it has been awhile. His blog posts, at his very awesome Blogging Is Futile, has been sparodic but always useful. Recently, he has been running a series of posts on cool unix tools that you might not know about. If you are a Unix or Linux system admin, or just a power users, I highly recommend you check them out. And if you are a fan of Debian, you need to have his blog on your reading list!!</p>
