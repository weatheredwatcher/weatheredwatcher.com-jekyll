<p>\n    It&rsquo;s been a little bit of a while since I&rsquo;ve written anything.  Here are a few updates.  I switched to Ubuntu (but it fucking sucks as a development enviroment
so I&rsquo;ll be switching soon to something else. Don&rsquo;t know yet&hellip;maybe I&rsquo;ll try SuSE 11.  I might go back to Gentoo&hellip;not sure just yet.</p>

<p>Recently, I&rsquo;ve been using Songbird for my media player Get it here. I think that I&rsquo;ll be using this for a while.  I also started using Aptana
for my IDE.  It is based on Eclipse and is pretty sweet.</p>

<p>I am currently working for the Instructional Design department of Midlands Technical College.  I am hacking wordpress like a ninja.  A Wordpress Ninja!  Yeah!</p>
