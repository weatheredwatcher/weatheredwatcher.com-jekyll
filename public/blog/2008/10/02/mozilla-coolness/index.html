<p>\n    Yesterday I got an invitation to a friends daugthter&rsquo;s 1st birthday.  Gmail, gives me a link to google maps to find the location (no&hellip;don&rsquo;t need a map) but there is no link to calendar.  You would think that gmail would give me such a link.  Well, here is a great time to test out the Mozilla Labs plugin Ubiquity!!!  I select the date and description of the event, right click and under the Ubiquity menu I click Add to Calendar.  When I loaded my GCal&hellip;.there is was!  Perfect!  A great Mozilla plugin!!</p>
