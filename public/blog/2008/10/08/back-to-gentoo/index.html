<p>\n    So I bought a new laptop the other day.  It&rsquo;s a Toshiba Satellite L355D-S7825.  It has an AMD Turion X2 64bit processor and an ATI-Radeon Graphics card.  It&rsquo;s pretty sweet.  I&rsquo;ve gone back and forth on the various distros and I have finally settled on Gentoo.  I don&rsquo;t like the politics at Debian and Ubuntu, and SuSE is a bit bloated for my needs.  Gentoo is great&hellip;and I&rsquo;ve always loved Portage the best of all the systems.  I&rsquo;m using a Itallian flavor of Gentoo called Sabayon.  I like that it&rsquo;s live installer works better than any other that I&rsquo;ve used..but it also gives you the flexibility of a Gentoo install.  The install took less than an hour and everything works out of the box with the exception of the wireless&hellip;.but when has that ever worked right out of the box :)  Sabayon has an interesting system called Entropy that allows for binary installs on Gentoo&hellip;seems to work pretty well.  I&rsquo;ve got most of my plugins and also Songbird installed.  Everything else seems great so far!!</p>
