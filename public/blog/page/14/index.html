  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    It&rsquo;s kind of funny.  I&rsquo;ve bought tons of stuff on craigslist.  From cell phones, to computers.  Even furniture. Half the stuff in our house we&rsquo;ve bought on craigslist.  I&rsquo;ve put stuff up for sale on craigslist as well.  The only responses that I&rsquo;ve ever got were from scammers.  I put up a computer.  Sure enough, some lady offers me $100 more than what I was asking for, because she wanted it sent to her special &ldquo;international shipping&rdquo; to Virginia.  And she wanted to pay with eBay.  I said only via check with ID faxed to me.  She insisted on eBay.  I said no dice.  I&rsquo;ve put a timeshare up for rent on craigslist.  Some guy in England wanted to rent it for a week and send the funds to me via a cashiers check that his company was giving him for his vacation.  Once again, no dice.  I thought nothing though of offering my services as a PC Reapair Tech on craigslist.  Come on.  I fix computer.  Then, I got the following email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi,
I saw your email on craigslist and i was hoping if you could help me
repair and install some applications on 15(fifteen)computers, kindly
get back to me if you will be available so i could provide you with
more details on what will be done on them, i will await your swift
response if you will be available,Thank you
Wilfort</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a possible situation.  But the language of the email made the cynic in me very skeptical.  I answered, waiting for the scam.  Sure enough, a few hours later I got this email back from him:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello,
Thank you for your reply, i have 15 (fifteen) HP computer(Intel Pentium IV) which broke down and i will need you to work on them</p>

<p>   Below are the things needed to be done one on each laptops:</p>

<p>1 Format Hard Drive
2 Microsoft Office Package
3 Install Win Xp with Service Pack 2
4 AVG Virus Software (Free Lifetime Updates)
5 Laptop Cleaning of the keyboard, screen and other case.
6 Adobe Acrobat
7 Diagnostics of the entire system after to check hard, CD Rom,floppy, etc.</p>

<p>   kindly let me know how much it will cost me for the service of all the computers, i have a shipping agent that will be shipping them down to you for the repair along with all the software necessary and after you done with the repair and installation the same shipping agent will be picking them up, the mode of payment is by a US certified check mailed and address to you from my company,I should have make this a phone order but  i am presently on tourism in a remote area in East Anglia and my phone is presently not on roam and also hard to get to a phohe boot around here.let me know if this is ok by you so we may proceed, i will await your quick response. Thank you
Wilfort</p></blockquote>

<p>This is just screaming: &ldquo;I think your a dumb idiot who will take my bait.&rdquo;  Did this guy read my ad?  Did he follow the link to my website and see my history and qualifications?  This is getting ridiculous.  The sad part is that people have to fall for this shit or it would not be continuing.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I threw up a quick site from iWeb for my daughter not too long ago and I&rsquo;ve decided to create a custom site for her all in Ruby on Rails.  This is mainly to test out rails a bit more so I can form a decent opinion of it vs. php.  Today, I also decided to see how Textmate  does as a Rails coder vs. Coda (which I use mostly now).  I recently ran an update of rails on the mac and when I started to configure the site by typing rails foto_devochka, all I got was a string of errors.  I tried upgrading everything&hellip;no luck.  I finally found a post on a Rails site that seemed to address my issue.  They recommended:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem update
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install rails
</code></pre>

<p>After this completed, rails worked again.  I created the app and tried to view it in the browser.  No dice.  I checked the dbase configuration.  Looked good.  Checked the server output.  It was complaining about sqlite.  Sqlite ships with Mac, so I&rsquo;ve never installed it before, but apparently, when I reinstalled rails, it lost all the gems. So:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
</code></pre>

<p>Did the trick.</p>

<p>With that little technical garbage out of the way, here is my setup for Textmate.  I&rsquo;m using Textmate in one space for development, a terminal in another space for server/console and I have safari loaded in a third space for testing.  I can easily switch between them using key-strokes, or clicking on the right icon in the dock.  The only issue that I can see is the one of ftp&#8217;ing stuff.  In Coda it is automatic.  I&rsquo;ll need yet another program to upload files with this set-up.</p>

<p>I admit, I still use Mac&rsquo;s terminal with Coda.  I also use Safari for previewing.  So I&rsquo;m not really using Coda to it&rsquo;s &ldquo;full&rdquo; potential here.  I do use Coda to take a peek at my views, and I have used it for terminal stuff, but it is really just as easy to use the bash shell that comes natively with Mac.  It&rsquo;s that damn ftp feature that I love so much.  I seriously doubt that I&rsquo;ll ever use Textmate for full blown Rails or php development.  It&rsquo;ll make a great text editor though.  It really is the culmination of emacs.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the site, shall we.  This is not my first site in Rails, so I quickly setup a framework and modify the routes.rb file.  Soon, my pages are working, just need a template now for the main pages.</p>

<p>Here are the pages that I&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<pre><code>script/generate controller Site index about gallery about
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create a site layout file.  IT contains the links.  A great little timesaver in rails is the</p>

<pre><code>link_to_unless_current
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the link, but will not link to it if is the current page.  Makes for a bit cleaner page.  I don&rsquo;t use it everywhere, but it&rsquo;s a good thought.</p>

<p>Now I just need some ajax goodies, so I&rsquo;ll load a bunch of javascript libraries that I&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "prototype.js" %&gt;
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "scriptaculous.js?load=effects,builder" %&gt;
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "lightbox.js" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s looking good and in no time!   I do like the flow but now that I&rsquo;ve got a little something to upload, I know I&rsquo;ll start missing Coda.  Okay, so I&rsquo;m also going to miss Coda when it comes to css.  Coda has spoiled me with it&rsquo;s css editor.</p>

<p>Well, that is it for now.  I&rsquo;ll be finishing up this site (in Coda) and then posting it to the web.  I&rsquo;ll post a link when it&rsquo;s fully functioning</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I&rsquo;ve been scrobbling tracks to last.fm for years now.  I just recently listened to the last.fm recommends using the iPhone app.  It&rsquo;s been solid for every track.  I&rsquo;ve enjoyed everything.  It&rsquo;s a truly remarkable service when a computer can figure out exactly what kind of music you like!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Just made a few updates. I added some simple jQuey navigation elements      to my ruby on rails site as well as some simple session managment to my personal site. As session management is very important to a dynamic site, I&rsquo;ll more than likely use that as my next tutorial entry.</p>

<p>Currently without work for three weeks, hopefull. Things are looking good as far as prospects.</p>
