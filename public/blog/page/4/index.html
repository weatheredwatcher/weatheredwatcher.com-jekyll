  <div class="entry-content"><p>Let me start out by saying that I have been waiting for this feature for a while now.  When ever I male forays into the world of Rails and Python I always come back to php just a little bit jealous of the testing servers that come with them.  Well, in just a little bit, I will be jealous no more!! \n First things first.  We must install the latest version of php.  I use Fedora for my development machine, so I am going to give you the steps you need in YUM for doing this.  I recommend a little google search for the easiest way to do this in your distro&hellip;.actually, you really need to setup a repo that will let you keep to the latest version of php anyway.
 I use the YUM repo at <a href="http://rpms.famillecollet.com/fedora/16/remi/x86_64/.">http://rpms.famillecollet.com/fedora/16/remi/x86_64/.</a> To install the repo into your system type:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://rpms.famillecollet.com/fedora/16/remi/x86_64/remi-release-16-6.fc16.remi.noarch.rpm
</code></pre>

<p>Follow that up with a:</p>

<pre><code>sudo rpm -Uvh remi-release*rpm
</code></pre>

<p>And then</p>

<pre><code> sudo yum --enablerepo=remi-test install php
</code></pre>

<p>And that will install the latest version of php and all it&rsquo;s dependencies!!
 Next we will need a proper test!  Lets install the latest version of CI and see if we can get it up and running!!
For this, I am going to clone the latest CI from git into a new folder and then run the server from there.  If you are following along at home, feel free to use whatever code you want!
So, to run the server, we cd into our site and type a simple:     php -S localhost:8000 (bear in mind that you can use whatever port you want..and even a server name other then local host&hellip;take a peak at the docs)

<pre><code>php server in the browser
</code></pre>

<p>So, first impressions are pretty cool!  It&rsquo;s time to get back to work, but I will be playing some more with this I assure you!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p> I finally had the time to sit down and write a RSS feed for my blog.  I obviously wrote it in php using codeigniter.  There are a few good tutorials out there, but let me add my own ten cents to the pile!!\n
 So the first spot is the controller.  I created a controller called Feed.  I also could have just created a method under my Blog controller, but I find this is a little bit neater code.</p>

<pre><code>function index()
{
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;helper('inflector');
        $this-&gt;load-&gt;helper('xml');  
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;helper('text');  
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;model('Blog_model', 'blog');    

    $data['entries'] = $this-&gt;blog-&gt;get_last_ten_entries();
    $this-&gt;load-&gt;view('rss', $data);


}
</code></pre>

<p> This loads the required CI helpers, as well as by Blog Model.  Notice that I am using a custom method in my model to retrieve the last ten entries.  I am reusing the same method that populated my main blog page.</p>

<p> The first thing to remember regarding the xml page that you define in your view is opening the xml using the echo statement.  The syntax would otherwise confuse the compiler.  After that we just use pure XML and insert our dynamic data with php short tags.  Surprisingly enough, that is it!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The creation of a wireframe is a very important part of the web development process.  Lots of different designers have their own way.  There are programs that you can use to make wireframes.  I personally prefer to draw mine by hand.  Here is an example of a few screens that I designed for a client. (add wireframe png later)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Technically we try and do this the first of the year, but time was not on our side.  For one thing, Luba started school this past fall, so we have a lot of stuff to do with that.  Also, I&rsquo;ve been very busy as well. But, better late then never!  This year I decided to introduce her to compiling&hellip;(she saw me compiling some server extensions and asked me why it was doing it by itself).  So, I&rsquo;ve been going back to my youth and playing around with c++ the past week (I am planning on getting back into application development) and so here is a cool little bit of code, daddy/daughter style.\n</p>

<p> If you are not familiar with the C languages, I am making use of a struct&hellip;.this is essentially the same as a class.  It&rsquo;s declared a bit differently, but the end is the same.  We created a person template in our structure and called two instances of it, yours and mine.
The first time that we compiled, it just asked for name and age.  Then we added the method to calculate the difference in the ages.  Obviously we need more structure to make sure that if the first person is younger then the second it will still be correct, but for a bit of daddy/daughter time it suffices.
 Fun was making mistakes and watching her see the compiler catch them!  Damn I love raising a geek..I do not know what I would do if she were interested in stuff like sports&hellip;=)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I can&rsquo;t tell you how many times I&rsquo;ve seen passwords put in databases using the md5 function that is built into php.  It is fast, easy to use and very insecure.  Granted, it&rsquo;s really just a last defense in case the database is accessed right?  True, but what if your users are in the majority of internet users who use the same passwords for everything?  So let&rsquo;s talk about using a little bit higher security on our passwords.\n</p>

<p>Here is a helper I wrote for Codeigniter
<a href="https://gist.github.com/1655410.js?file=brypt-helper.php">https://gist.github.com/1655410.js?file=brypt-helper.php</a></p>

<p> So here is what you need to know: We are using the function crypt().  The syntax for crypt is:</p>

<pre><code>crypt(string $string, seed $seed);
</code></pre>

<p>Check the php references for details on the other methods of encryption.  We are only talking about bcrypt or bluefish toad
 The way that we specify that it is bluefish that we infact want to use is in the seed itself.  We prefix it with a $2a$05$.  The first part, $2a$ is what give us the encryption method, bluefish.  The second part, $05$ sets how many passes will be used.  The more passes, the more secure, but also the longer it takes to encrypt.  The seed is the key.  By using a seed that is unique, it makes it impossible to break the hash with what is called a &ldquo;rainbow table.&rdquo;  You make a rainbow table by compiling a dictionary of words and running them through the hash (md5, sha, bluefish) and this gives you a massive list of possible passwords and their hashes.  The adding of a seed removes the chances that the password/hash will be in a rainbow table.  The use of a seed is pretty effective in making the password unbreakable&hellip;.well that is if only the hash was exposed&hellip;the seed is typically located in the table right next to the hash!</p>
