  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I&rsquo;ve been exploring Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript.  It&rsquo;s been an interesting experience because JavaScript is not really a traditional Object Oriented Language but rather a prototype language.  Prototype is  a type of object oriented language that is classless.  In a prototype language, inheritance is achieved by reusing prototypes of objects.  It is a fascinating model.    So let&rsquo;s get started on our exploration of class-less object oriented programming
The first thing of note is that we are not actually creating a class (note:Classless Object Oriented JavaScript) Essentially, all we are going to do is create the equivilent of a constructor.Â  Our constructor will have an alert box that fires whenever we create a new object, as well as some basic properties of our car.
Now, when ever we create a new Car prototype, we get this alert.  It&rsquo;s a great way to make sure it&rsquo;s working!  Now lets add some variables to our class.  For a car we will need a make a model and a color.</p>

<p>Now, after the function, we need to do a little bit more.</p>

<p>This sets the default value of the make, model and color.  It also introduces us to the prototype property.  Later, we will use this prototype property to create our sports car class that inherits the Car class.   Now we are all set to create some cars!</p>

<p>The cool thing about JavaScript is how methods are handled.  We actually define a function with the prototype property.  Just remember that we need to use &lsquo;this&rsquo; to access the variable in the class.</p>

<p>Go ahead and play around a bit with this.  Next, we will talk about how you can use prototype to create another class that inherits another class.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I have been using Google &ldquo;products&rdquo; for years now.  When every something new comes out, I just have to give it a try.  I love Google Notebook, but it seems that not enough people shared my love.  Of course Gmail can be called life changing.  Another great product that has gotten me through a lot is Calendar.  Being able to sync work and classes and family events in a place that is accessible anywhere is a very cool thing indeed.    I also have to say that I love my Mac and my iPhone.  Syncing the three is fairly easy.  You subscribe to your calendars in iCal, and sync iCal with the iPhone.  The only thing is, my iPhone is always with me, the Mac and iCal not always.  So it became necessary to find a way to create a two way sync between Google Calendar and my iPhone.  Oh yeah, and I have more than one calendar and I want them all to sync.  Using the Exchange server on the iPhone to connect was easy, but I didn&rsquo;t like have the mail was handled.  IMAP works just fine thank you very much.  Also, it only syncs your primary calendar.  If I created other calendars, or subscribe to others, they don&rsquo;t even show up.  I found some articles on how to sync using CalDav and it seemed to be just right for my needs.  To sync your primary calendar, add a new CalDav to the iPHone and enter this in as your url:  <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/you@gmail.com/user">https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/you@gmail.com/user/</a>  Add your google username and password and you should be good to go.  Now, for the other calendars, you need to goto your calendars in google and take a look at the ical link.  In the string, you should see a gianormous string @group.calendar.google.com.  Write that down.  Then, add another caldav calendar and in the url enter this: <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/">https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/</a>[string of numbers and letters]@group.calendar.google.com/user/  Fill in the username and password same as above.  And there you go!  A few things to note:</p>

<p><em>You must use https
</em>The url will disapear in both instances and be repalced my <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a> It&rsquo;s suppose to</p>

<p>On another note, I have been playing around a bit with Thunderbird 3 and I am impressed with it as a mail client.  I found a Lifehacker article that talked about hacking a tab to display Google Wave permanently and that&rsquo;s made Thunderbird very useful.  I used Thunderbird for my email in Linux so I am comfortable with it.  The only thing that is a bit cumbersome is the calendar extension, Lightning.  Sure I installed a Nightly Build for 3 and it works fine, but Google Calendar Syncing is a bit of an issue.  Once again, I can subscribe as caldav to Google Calendar (use the aboce strings, but change /user to /events) The only issue is that I can&rsquo;t add or change secondary calendars in Lightning.  It has some permissions issues with Google that havn&rsquo;t been worked out yet.  So I applied the same hack that let me have Google Wave in my Thunderbird to give me Google Calendar in my Thunderbird.  The result is a great , quick fix to the Calendar syncing issue!</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Today we are going to create a mailer class that will assist us in emailing site visitors.  Lets start out buy creating the class and the variables we will need.</p>

<pre><code>class Mailer {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, let see.  We will need a sender, a recipient, a subject and a body. Well, if you know anything about email, the sender is set in the header.  So&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>class Mailer {
    var $headers; 
    var $recipient;
    var $subject; 
    var $message;  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now comes the fun part!  Lets build the email!</p>

<p>First we have a from setter:</p>

<pre><code>function from($email, $name){   
     $this-&gt;headers[] = 'From: '.$email.' ';
 }
</code></pre>

<p>What we have done, is we have appended the required format for the Header.  In php the &lsquo;.&rsquo; is what we use to concatenate strings and variable data together.  Also, note that the header is an array.  We could add more than just &ldquo;From&rdquo; to the header if we needed to.</p>

<p>Now we add rest of the functions.</p>

<pre><code>function add_recipient($email){

    $this-&gt;recipient = $email;
 }


 function subject($subject){  

    $this-&gt;subject = $subject;
 }

 function message($message) {

    $this-&gt;message = $message;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we don&rsquo;t have any getter methods defined.  Although it&rsquo;s a good practice to have them in your class for a program, it would just add extra stuff to a class that&rsquo;s sole purpose in life is to run a contact me page.  Now, if you wanted to use this in a larger site.  Say a cms or a social portal, you would want to add a bunch more functions to it.  That way you could get all of your email functionality out of a single class file.</p>

<p>But for now, this is enough.  Let&rsquo;s create a utillity function to send the mail.</p>

<pre><code>function send()
{  //sends the email

    $headers = "";
        foreach($this-&gt;headers as $header)
        {
           $headers .= $header.';';
        }
        return mail($this-&gt;recipient, $this-&gt;subject, $this-&gt;message, $headers);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, we add all the header information, then the rest of the data is pulled into the mail function.</p>

<p>And how do we use this?  By now I hope that you understand the layout of my driver files.  So it&rsquo;s your turn.  Create a contact form and use this class to make it work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Yesterday we talked about some basics in oo php programming.  To day I am going to show you how to extend a class and also how to be utillity methods (functions) in your class.</p>

<p>Yesterday we created a car class called Car.  To today we will extend that class with a sportsCarClass.  Why, you might ask, do we want to do this?  It&rsquo;s simple.  I might want to create several different types of cars. Maybe I want a SUV car object, or a truck object. All of these objects will have certain properties that are the same (make, model, color, ect)  Why wouldn&rsquo;t I reuse the code that I already have?  I could copy-paste, but that would only serve to make my program a whole lot larger than it needs to be.  So, instead, I&rsquo;ll extend my base class to make other classes.  The one that I&rsquo;ll be demonstrating is the sportsCarClass.  We start out by declaring the class and extending the base class, followed by declaring any variables that this new class will be using.</p>

<pre><code>class sportsCar extends Car  {
    var $engine;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In case you are wondering, this is in the same class file as our original carClass.</p>

<p>Next we will define some setter and getter functions for the sports car class.</p>

<pre><code>function add_engine($type){ 

    $this-&gt;engine = $type;
 }
    function get_engine(){  

     return $this-&gt;engine;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to show you how to use this in your driver program.  Give it a go!  You will notice that you can create a new sportsCar and set make, model, color and engine and it will work, even though you don&rsquo;t have any setter functions for make, model or color in your class.  Also, if you try and set the engine type in a Car, it will fail because Car cannot see sportsCar.</p>

<p>At this point, it might be a good time to point out a few items of importance.  Did you notice that in our driver program we call the functions using the class name followed by &ndash;> and the function?  We refer to the variables in our class in the same way, but we use $this instead of the class name.  This is important, because we can also use this to pull variables into other function in our class in this same way.</p>

<p>Lets make a utillity function that will display our object in an easy to read format.</p>

<pre><code>function show_car(){
            echo('Make: '.$this-&gt;make.'');
            echo('Model: '.$this-&gt;model.'');
            echo('Color: '.$this-&gt;color.'');
            echo('Engine: '.$this-&gt;engine.'');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next time we will use oo programming to do something infinitely more useful.  We will create a mailer class that can be used in a contact form.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I&rsquo;ve casually referenced oo php recently.  So here I am going to give a more formal tutorial on object oriented php for anyone out there who is unaware of OO programming in general.  If you are familiar with OO programming, you will understand everything immediately.</p>

<p>The first thing that we are going to create is a class.  This class will allow us to make an object based on that class.</p>

<p>Think of a class as a cookie cutter.  We make objects from this class.  Each object should be the same as all the others, except for the data that we place into the object.</p>

<pre><code>class Car
{  
   var $make;      
   var $model;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we have defined our class &ldquo;Car&rdquo; as well as two variables, &ldquo;make&rdquo; and &ldquo;model.&rdquo;  Now we have to make some setter methods for our class</p>

<pre><code>function add_make($name)
 {  
    $this-&gt;make = $name;
 }
</code></pre>

<p> function add_model($name)</p>

<pre><code> {  
    $this-&gt;model = $name;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>These two functions set the variables for the make and model.  The next functions are called getter methods, because they &lsquo;get&rsquo; the data from the object.</p>

<pre><code>function get_make()
{  
   return $this-&gt;make;
}

function get_model()
{ 
    return $this-&gt;model;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next we will build a driver file to test out our class.</p>

<pre><code>require_once('carClass.php');

$myCar = new Car;
$myCar-&gt;add_make("Ford");
$myCar-&gt;add_model("Explorer");


echo $myCar-&gt;get_make();
echo $myCar-&gt;get_model();
</code></pre>

<p>Basically, we first create a new object &ldquo;Car&rdquo; called myCar.  Then we add a make and a model to the Car object.  Finally, we echo off the variables to see what we have set them as.</p>

<p>Here is the complete class file for you to study.  For homework, make a getter and setter method for color and then add it to the driver file.</p>

<p>carClass.php:</p>

<pre><code>class Car
{  
   var $make;      
   var $model;
   var $color;


 function add_make($name)
 {  
    $this-&gt;make = $name;
 }

 function add_model($name)
 {  
    $this-&gt;model = $name;
 }

 function get_make()
 {  
    return $this-&gt;make;
 }

 function get_model()
 {  
     return $this-&gt;model;
 }


}
</code></pre>
