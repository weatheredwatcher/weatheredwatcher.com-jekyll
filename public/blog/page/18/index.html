David needs someone to really flesh out what he is about&hellip;.unicorns, dragons&hellip; and sandwich making..
Unicorns?</p>

<p>David needs to become more tolerant, especially of emotions. &hellip; David needs to be able to do this work independently. &hellip;
Thats right!  Tolerance and Independence!</p>

<p>Dirty David needs a wash
Yes! Wash me!</p>

<p>David needs a steady influence
Steady influence for what?</p>

<p>David needs your help
Yes, send money!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    That&rsquo;s right boys and girls, I now own a Macbook.  And I see no reason to put linux on it.   It all started, you could say, with Songbird.  I love the Songbird player for linux it is very nice and has tons of great features, but after a kernel backport to get my wireless working, Songbird started seg faulting. I install, uninstalled, reinstalled, compiled from source.  I always got the same seg fault.  I&rsquo;ve had issues of this nature before, and usually I format and reinstall linux on my system.  The only problem is, that this is my development platform.  I work on my laptop.  I can&rsquo;t continually have issues that require time consuming reinstalls.  On top of all this, I just got an iPhone and realized right off the bat that without iTunes, the experience would be painful.  So I got a really great deal on a carbon-fiber Macbook.  I don&rsquo;t know how I lived this long without it!</p>

<p>For starters, everything just works.  I press a button and my calendars are all synced (iCal, iPhone, GCal) as are my mailboxes, bookmarks and songs.</p>

<p>I also don&rsquo;t feel like I am betraying my roots, because MacOSX IS freebsd after all. If I want to see a terminal, it&rsquo;s easy.  One of the first things that I did was take over the root account</p>

<pre><code>sudo passwd
</code></pre>

<p>and volia!  your root is belong to me!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I am currently using a mixed Ubuntu/Debian system.  I have always liked the apt system, and Debian has been the distro that I have used the most, but I&rsquo;ve always had two major beefs with them. </p>

<p>1) I don&rsquo;t like how loooong it takes for them to catch up&hellip;Come on, Lenny was released on Valentines Day and they are still using Gnome 2.22 and Offfice 2.2!!  </p>

<p>2) They can be just a bit to fanatical at times&hellip;Like the whole Firefox thing&hellip;..</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I also initially had a few beefs with Ubuntu.</p>

<p>1) I can&rsquo;t stand the names.  Intrepid Ibex? Come on now&hellip;.</p>

<p>2) They seemed initially to be creating a massive fork from Debian that I didn&rsquo;t like.  We already have three major RPM standards&hellip;.could we keep a deb a deb for crying out loud.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Although I still am not so fond of the naming conventions, Ubuntu seems to be keeping to the standard debs some what.  I;ve not yet found a deb I couldn&rsquo;t install, be it either for Debian or Ubuntu, and when I recently install Debian Etch, I found most Ubuntu deb would install little or no problem as well.</p>

<p>I choose Ubuntu as my base mainly for the kernel, gnome.  I stil had to install OO from the site to get 3.  I also get Firefox 3 in Ubuntu and not Iceweasle (don&rsquo;t ask me why it makes a difference, it just does okay.) I also hooked up the unstable/testing debian repos and I&rsquo;ve exponetially increased my installable app base.  So all and all I am very pleased with my system.</p>
