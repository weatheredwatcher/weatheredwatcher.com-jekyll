  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    So here is the background:  At our last Mac User&rsquo;s Group gathering, my good friend and Ruby on Rails Jedi, Jed Schneider in the process of his talk showed a pretty nifty little ruby script that created a single file that repeated the same line over and over again a set number of times.  It was pretty sweet.  Fast forward to almost a week later and I am having to create a massive amount of test data for some final testing.  I need to create a grand total of 61 csv files, all with different names but that contain the same five email address (as well as some other information)  So I decided to try and implement a solution in Ruby, drawing on the concepts of Jed&rsquo;s script. <a href="http://www.iangreulichonline.com">Ian</a>and I sat down for a spare second and knocked out a little script that does just that.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough (or un-surprisingly enough if you are a ruby programmer) that&rsquo;s all she wrote.</p>

<p>The line 1.upto(61) relies on the fact that in Ruby everything is an object.  We want to output the numbers 1 through 61.  We use |i| to catch the output into a variable i then use File.open to create a file called test1.csv through test61.csv.  For each file we want to write some lines.  Each line can be written with file.puts.  Notice that we pass the name of our file to a variable called file with |file| just like we did for i above.</p>

<p>So after I created 61 csv files with different names but the same data, I decided to check and see if ruby could help me with any of the other test data generation.  Of course it could!</p>

<p>The next little bit of code is really just based on the code above.  Instead of writing the same line of data to 61 different files, I wanted to write 61 different email address to one file, using the same base.</p>

<p>Considering that this is pretty much the same as the previous script, only inside out, I&rsquo;m sure you can figure it out without much effort.</p>

<p>This Ruby Wow Moment was brought to you by the Letter R and the Number Awesome</p>

<p>Questions? Comments?  Any ruby Jedi&rsquo;s out there that can see of a better way of doing this?  I await your comments with much anticipation!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>   One major headache in any major project is how you are going to handle the errors.  For starters, it is not a good idea to show errors on a live, production site.  But on the other hand, you don&rsquo;t want your system to blow-up and you not know what has happened.  There are lots of ways that you could handle this situation.  This is just the way that I am handling it on my current project.  Background: My current project is a behind-the-firewall-intranet application.  It is not accessible for out side the office.  So it&rsquo;s safe to leave error messages on&hellip;except for the fact that no one wants to see the error messages except for me.  I was given the task of making errors as terse and minimum as possible in their output, while at the same time recording more detailed information in some kind of log file that could be seen my anyone who wanted to know more information.</p>

<p><em>set_error_handler</em></p>

<p>The first bit of magic that I used to accomplish my goals is the set_error_handler tag.  Essentially, we create a function, when passed the error codes, out puts user friendly message and can even keep the program running after a near fatal error.</p>

<p>We pass the function the error number, string, file and line number.  This allows us to create useful output.  We can even branch out further, displaying different messages depending on the error number.</p>

<p>The only thing we have to do to make this work is to place the function set_error_handler(&ldquo;myErrorHandler&rdquo;); on every page that you want this custom error handling to occur.</p>

<p>The next step was to figure out a way to store the data without actually displaying it.  To do this, I wrote a simple class file that writes data to a database.  You can just as well write the data to file.  The principle is the same.</p>

<p>The new function for handling the errors looks like this:</p>

<p>This way, I can use simple checks to see if processes for successful or not, writing any messages to a log to check later.  I also dump the contents of the log in a table so that if a user throws an error, they could potentially see what that error was.</p>

<p>Feel free to use this code in your own projects.  You can always change it to write to a flat file, csv or xml file.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Ever since the iPad was announced the other day, I have been giving a lot of thought to it.  I have to admit, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about cloud computing the past few weeks, and this just gave those thoughts a whole new avenue.  The biggest thought that I have is this: Could I, a developer, use the iPad as my primary computing device?</p>

<p>Well, for starters, what do I use my Mac Book for that I couldn&rsquo;t use the iPad for.  The answer is not that much.  I develop my own personal website, do a lot of stuff with JavaScript, PHP and Rails.  I write, play around in Photoshop,  email, twitter, blog, listen to music on iTunes and surf the web.</p>

<p>Ever since I got a full time job, I&rsquo;ve not been consulting much. Most of the heavy coding I do at work on my Mac desktop.</p>

<p>So, in order to use the iPad there are some &ldquo;products&rdquo;/functionality that must be replaced/replicated.</p>

<p>Email: I use Mail for my email, so what difference does it make to me if it is on the mac or iPad?  I use my iPhone for about half my email now anyway.</p>

<p>Browsing: For this one I might miss Firefox some, but I still use Safari about 25% of the time anyway.  I also browse a lot on my iPhone.  The larger screen would be nice.</p>

<p>Tweeting: I use Twitterific both on the mac and the iPhone, so no issues there</p>

<p>Blogging: I usually use the web interface, but I also have used the WordPress app.  I think that on the iPad, this would be a far better experience than on the iPhone</p>

<p>Writing: With iWorks AND Google docs, I think it is safe to say that this is a no-brainer. I would more than likely want the keyboard for the iPad for any major writting&hellip;but doable.</p>

<p>Photos: I have been working to get all my photos on PicasaWeb anyway.  Photos are an easy issue.  I also have a Photoshop.com account and the iPhone app for Photoshop.com rocks.  GIve Adobe a sec to get it updated for the iPad and I am in business.</p>

<p>This leaves me to the two hardest aspects: Music and Coding.  For music I would have to cheat just the tiniest bit.  I would have to store my music on my wife&rsquo;s pc and use iTunes to keep the iPad and iPhone with music&hellip;but I can also use LastFM whenever I have a WiFi connection (or always on the iPhone) to listen to my library as well as LastFM&rsquo;s picks for me :).  Also, if Apple brings iTunes into the cloud, then there is a major issue fixed.</p>

<p>This now leaves coding.  I have been playing around with Bespin since it first started in the Mozilla Labs. It&rsquo;s a great place to store and edit code in the cloud.  That being said, until they get Git support, I will only be able to test HTML and JavaScript in Bespin.  In walks <a href="http://www.kodingen.com">http://www.kodingen.com</a>.  This service is built around a Bespin core, gives you testing servers for PHP, Rails as well as Perl and Python support.  The three open source Database players are there: MySQL Postgres and SQLite.  It is a developers dream land.  Slick and stylish.  With this final piece of the puzzle, I really could live for sometime developing and living in the cloud on an iPad.</p>

<p>What do you think guys?  Should I do it?  Leave me comments and let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I got a new mac at my job.  I opted for a Mac Mini, fully upgraded to 4gigs of ram and a single 500gb harddrive.  I also got two 20&#8221; HD LCD monitors.  It&rsquo;s a sweet deal.  Here is a side-by-side screen shot of both on the desktop.</p>

<img src="http://weatheredwatcher.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/media_httpimgskitchco_igqiy-scaled500.jpg" alt="desktop" /></p>

<p>Since I use the machine mainly for web-development, I have a slew of browsers installed, including IE8 via Windows 7, Bootcamp and Parallels.  I created aliases for each browser and placed them in a stack on the dock for easy access</p>

<p><img src="http://weatheredwatcher.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/media_httpimgskitchco_kbsoc-scaled500.jpg" alt="desktop" /></p>

<p>Another thing I like to do is use the Secret plugin to hide the desktop and then load the desktop via  a stack on the dock as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Merry Christmas!  Today is also my daughter&rsquo;s fourth birthday.  She sat with me and helped me prepare for this lesson..  We created a Girl class and a Girl object called Luba.  Then we made her sing!  It was alot of fun.  I don&rsquo;t think she understood Object Oriented Programming, but it was a great start.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to do a little bit more on prototype and why this is a pretty cool concept.  For starters, lets take a look at our previous class, Car.  What if I took a look at my class and decided that it was not enough.</p>

<pre><code>function Car (make, model, carColor){
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this carColor = carColor;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What if I needed to add another property, say engineSize, I could add a line in my class and hae engineSize, but what if I only need a property if a certain condition occurs.  This is where the prototype property is a great thing.  I highly recommend you use firebug and give this code a try.  It might not be programmatically practical, but it is a great exercise.</p>

<p>Go ahead, open firebug and switch to the console.  I highly recommend that you switch the command line to Larger Command Line &ndash; this gives you a large command block on the right hand side.  Now, enter the following code into the command line and run it.</p>

<pre><code>function Car(make, model, carColor){
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.carColor = carColor;
       alert('Smell that new car smell!');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once you see the results in the console, clear the command line and enter this code</p>

<pre><code>var myCar = new Car('Ford','Mustang','Red');
</code></pre>

<p>You should have seen the prompt that new car was created.  So now we have a new object that we can play with.</p>

<p>Now lets define a new property and call it carsMPH.</p>

<p>Since we are running this is the console, we really can&rsquo;t re-do the class, so we will use the prototype property.</p>

<pre><code>Car.prototype.carsMPH = 'How Fast';
</code></pre>

<p>If you type alert(myCar.carsMPH); you will get &lsquo;How Fast&rsquo;.  This is because we have not set a unique value for this variable and so the default is used.  We can define the cars speed with</p>

<pre><code>myCar.carsMPH = '30';
</code></pre>

<p>Now we follow up with the previous alert and we now get 30.  Here we come on another issue.  Having to enter in the alert phrase over and over again is a bit annoying.  So lets create a method that will display the cars speed.  Once again, since we aren&rsquo;t able to change our class after it&rsquo;s run, we will use prototype.</p>

<pre><code>Car.prototype.speed = function(){
    alert('You are going ' + this.carsMPH + ' miles per hour');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now all you have to do is type myCar.speed(); and a dialog box pops up and shows you how fast our car is going.</p>

<p>So there you go!  That was a bit more indepth overview of prototype and classless object oriented programming in JavaScript.  With that background out of the way I think that we can move on to some more complex concepts.</p>
