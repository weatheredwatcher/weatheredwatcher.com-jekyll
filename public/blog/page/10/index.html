  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Ever since the iPad was announced the other day, I have been giving a lot of thought to it.  I have to admit, I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about cloud computing the past few weeks, and this just gave those thoughts a whole new avenue.  The biggest thought that I have is this: Could I, a developer, use the iPad as my primary computing device?</p>

<p>Well, for starters, what do I use my Mac Book for that I couldn&rsquo;t use the iPad for.  The answer is not that much.  I develop my own personal website, do a lot of stuff with JavaScript, PHP and Rails.  I write, play around in Photoshop,  email, twitter, blog, listen to music on iTunes and surf the web.</p>

<p>Ever since I got a full time job, I&rsquo;ve not been consulting much. Most of the heavy coding I do at work on my Mac desktop.</p>

<p>So, in order to use the iPad there are some &ldquo;products&rdquo;/functionality that must be replaced/replicated.</p>

<p>Email: I use Mail for my email, so what difference does it make to me if it is on the mac or iPad?  I use my iPhone for about half my email now anyway.</p>

<p>Browsing: For this one I might miss Firefox some, but I still use Safari about 25% of the time anyway.  I also browse a lot on my iPhone.  The larger screen would be nice.</p>

<p>Tweeting: I use Twitterific both on the mac and the iPhone, so no issues there</p>

<p>Blogging: I usually use the web interface, but I also have used the WordPress app.  I think that on the iPad, this would be a far better experience than on the iPhone</p>

<p>Writing: With iWorks AND Google docs, I think it is safe to say that this is a no-brainer. I would more than likely want the keyboard for the iPad for any major writting&hellip;but doable.</p>

<p>Photos: I have been working to get all my photos on PicasaWeb anyway.  Photos are an easy issue.  I also have a Photoshop.com account and the iPhone app for Photoshop.com rocks.  GIve Adobe a sec to get it updated for the iPad and I am in business.</p>

<p>This leaves me to the two hardest aspects: Music and Coding.  For music I would have to cheat just the tiniest bit.  I would have to store my music on my wife&rsquo;s pc and use iTunes to keep the iPad and iPhone with music&hellip;but I can also use LastFM whenever I have a WiFi connection (or always on the iPhone) to listen to my library as well as LastFM&rsquo;s picks for me :).  Also, if Apple brings iTunes into the cloud, then there is a major issue fixed.</p>

<p>This now leaves coding.  I have been playing around with Bespin since it first started in the Mozilla Labs. It&rsquo;s a great place to store and edit code in the cloud.  That being said, until they get Git support, I will only be able to test HTML and JavaScript in Bespin.  In walks <a href="http://www.kodingen.com">http://www.kodingen.com</a>.  This service is built around a Bespin core, gives you testing servers for PHP, Rails as well as Perl and Python support.  The three open source Database players are there: MySQL Postgres and SQLite.  It is a developers dream land.  Slick and stylish.  With this final piece of the puzzle, I really could live for sometime developing and living in the cloud on an iPad.</p>

<p>What do you think guys?  Should I do it?  Leave me comments and let me know!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I got a new mac at my job.  I opted for a Mac Mini, fully upgraded to 4gigs of ram and a single 500gb harddrive.  I also got two 20&#8221; HD LCD monitors.  It&rsquo;s a sweet deal.  Here is a side-by-side screen shot of both on the desktop.</p>

<img src="http://weatheredwatcher.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/media_httpimgskitchco_igqiy-scaled500.jpg" alt="desktop" /></p>

<p>Since I use the machine mainly for web-development, I have a slew of browsers installed, including IE8 via Windows 7, Bootcamp and Parallels.  I created aliases for each browser and placed them in a stack on the dock for easy access</p>

<p><img src="http://weatheredwatcher.files.wordpress.com/2010/01/media_httpimgskitchco_kbsoc-scaled500.jpg" alt="desktop" /></p>

<p>Another thing I like to do is use the Secret plugin to hide the desktop and then load the desktop via  a stack on the dock as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Merry Christmas!  Today is also my daughter&rsquo;s fourth birthday.  She sat with me and helped me prepare for this lesson..  We created a Girl class and a Girl object called Luba.  Then we made her sing!  It was alot of fun.  I don&rsquo;t think she understood Object Oriented Programming, but it was a great start.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to do a little bit more on prototype and why this is a pretty cool concept.  For starters, lets take a look at our previous class, Car.  What if I took a look at my class and decided that it was not enough.</p>

<pre><code>function Car (make, model, carColor){
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this carColor = carColor;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What if I needed to add another property, say engineSize, I could add a line in my class and hae engineSize, but what if I only need a property if a certain condition occurs.  This is where the prototype property is a great thing.  I highly recommend you use firebug and give this code a try.  It might not be programmatically practical, but it is a great exercise.</p>

<p>Go ahead, open firebug and switch to the console.  I highly recommend that you switch the command line to Larger Command Line &ndash; this gives you a large command block on the right hand side.  Now, enter the following code into the command line and run it.</p>

<pre><code>function Car(make, model, carColor){
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.carColor = carColor;
       alert('Smell that new car smell!');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Once you see the results in the console, clear the command line and enter this code</p>

<pre><code>var myCar = new Car('Ford','Mustang','Red');
</code></pre>

<p>You should have seen the prompt that new car was created.  So now we have a new object that we can play with.</p>

<p>Now lets define a new property and call it carsMPH.</p>

<p>Since we are running this is the console, we really can&rsquo;t re-do the class, so we will use the prototype property.</p>

<pre><code>Car.prototype.carsMPH = 'How Fast';
</code></pre>

<p>If you type alert(myCar.carsMPH); you will get &lsquo;How Fast&rsquo;.  This is because we have not set a unique value for this variable and so the default is used.  We can define the cars speed with</p>

<pre><code>myCar.carsMPH = '30';
</code></pre>

<p>Now we follow up with the previous alert and we now get 30.  Here we come on another issue.  Having to enter in the alert phrase over and over again is a bit annoying.  So lets create a method that will display the cars speed.  Once again, since we aren&rsquo;t able to change our class after it&rsquo;s run, we will use prototype.</p>

<pre><code>Car.prototype.speed = function(){
    alert('You are going ' + this.carsMPH + ' miles per hour');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now all you have to do is type myCar.speed(); and a dialog box pops up and shows you how fast our car is going.</p>

<p>So there you go!  That was a bit more indepth overview of prototype and classless object oriented programming in JavaScript.  With that background out of the way I think that we can move on to some more complex concepts.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I&rsquo;ve been exploring Object Oriented Programming with JavaScript.  It&rsquo;s been an interesting experience because JavaScript is not really a traditional Object Oriented Language but rather a prototype language.  Prototype is  a type of object oriented language that is classless.  In a prototype language, inheritance is achieved by reusing prototypes of objects.  It is a fascinating model.    So let&rsquo;s get started on our exploration of class-less object oriented programming
The first thing of note is that we are not actually creating a class (note:Classless Object Oriented JavaScript) Essentially, all we are going to do is create the equivilent of a constructor.  Our constructor will have an alert box that fires whenever we create a new object, as well as some basic properties of our car.
Now, when ever we create a new Car prototype, we get this alert.  It&rsquo;s a great way to make sure it&rsquo;s working!  Now lets add some variables to our class.  For a car we will need a make a model and a color.</p>

<p>Now, after the function, we need to do a little bit more.</p>

<p>This sets the default value of the make, model and color.  It also introduces us to the prototype property.  Later, we will use this prototype property to create our sports car class that inherits the Car class.   Now we are all set to create some cars!</p>

<p>The cool thing about JavaScript is how methods are handled.  We actually define a function with the prototype property.  Just remember that we need to use &lsquo;this&rsquo; to access the variable in the class.</p>

<p>Go ahead and play around a bit with this.  Next, we will talk about how you can use prototype to create another class that inherits another class.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I have been using Google &ldquo;products&rdquo; for years now.  When every something new comes out, I just have to give it a try.  I love Google Notebook, but it seems that not enough people shared my love.  Of course Gmail can be called life changing.  Another great product that has gotten me through a lot is Calendar.  Being able to sync work and classes and family events in a place that is accessible anywhere is a very cool thing indeed.    I also have to say that I love my Mac and my iPhone.  Syncing the three is fairly easy.  You subscribe to your calendars in iCal, and sync iCal with the iPhone.  The only thing is, my iPhone is always with me, the Mac and iCal not always.  So it became necessary to find a way to create a two way sync between Google Calendar and my iPhone.  Oh yeah, and I have more than one calendar and I want them all to sync.  Using the Exchange server on the iPhone to connect was easy, but I didn&rsquo;t like have the mail was handled.  IMAP works just fine thank you very much.  Also, it only syncs your primary calendar.  If I created other calendars, or subscribe to others, they don&rsquo;t even show up.  I found some articles on how to sync using CalDav and it seemed to be just right for my needs.  To sync your primary calendar, add a new CalDav to the iPHone and enter this in as your url:  <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/you@gmail.com/user">https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/you@gmail.com/user/</a>  Add your google username and password and you should be good to go.  Now, for the other calendars, you need to goto your calendars in google and take a look at the ical link.  In the string, you should see a gianormous string @group.calendar.google.com.  Write that down.  Then, add another caldav calendar and in the url enter this: <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/">https://www.google.com/calendar/dav/</a>[string of numbers and letters]@group.calendar.google.com/user/  Fill in the username and password same as above.  And there you go!  A few things to note:</p>

<p><em>You must use https
</em>The url will disapear in both instances and be repalced my <a href="https://www.google.com">https://www.google.com</a> It&rsquo;s suppose to</p>

<p>On another note, I have been playing around a bit with Thunderbird 3 and I am impressed with it as a mail client.  I found a Lifehacker article that talked about hacking a tab to display Google Wave permanently and that&rsquo;s made Thunderbird very useful.  I used Thunderbird for my email in Linux so I am comfortable with it.  The only thing that is a bit cumbersome is the calendar extension, Lightning.  Sure I installed a Nightly Build for 3 and it works fine, but Google Calendar Syncing is a bit of an issue.  Once again, I can subscribe as caldav to Google Calendar (use the aboce strings, but change /user to /events) The only issue is that I can&rsquo;t add or change secondary calendars in Lightning.  It has some permissions issues with Google that havn&rsquo;t been worked out yet.  So I applied the same hack that let me have Google Wave in my Thunderbird to give me Google Calendar in my Thunderbird.  The result is a great , quick fix to the Calendar syncing issue!</p>
