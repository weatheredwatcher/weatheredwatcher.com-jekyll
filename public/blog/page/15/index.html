  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I&rsquo;ve been trying out a lot of IDE&rsquo;s lately.  I&rsquo;ve decided to post a run down of them and blog about my personal preferences.  I&rsquo;ve used the following IDE&rsquo;s</p>

<p><em>Netbeans
</em>Eclipse
<em>Coda
</em>Dreamweaver
<em>Aptana (Eclipse based)
</em>Zend Studio 7 (Eclipse based)</p>

<p>For starters, I&rsquo;ve used Netbeans for a very long time.  I am very familiar with it&rsquo;s features and know my way way around very well.  It has very good support for php and the even has a great php community around it.  I really enjoy they way Netbeans handles code completion and also it has a great snippet functionality built in.  I particularly enjoy the ability to search entire projects for a string.  It makes finding functions in unfamiliar frameworks a piece of cake.</p>

<p>Then there is Eclipse.  I&rsquo;m going to start with Eclipse and then fill in the other two Eclipse based ide&rsquo;s afterwards.  I find Eclipse to be slow. It is also a rather bulky interface.  Maybe, you might say I&rsquo;d like it better if I had used it before Netbeans&hellip;.no&hellip;I actually used Eclipse long before I knew of Netbeans.  It&rsquo;s always been a bit clunky for me.  All in all, it has allot of the same features of Netbeans, and for most people, I&rsquo;m sure it really is just a matter of taste.</p>

<p>I used Aptana for a little bit on a project a while ago and it appears to be a fairly solid little ide.  It comes pre-loaded with all the Eclipse plugins that you need to code web 2.0.  It has loads of templates and javascript snippets to help you along.  It just is still Eclipse.</p>

<p>I most recently decided to give Zend Studio 7 a run around the block.  Once again, Zend builds on the Eclipse platform, but unlike Aptana, which has a fairly refreshed interface, Zend 7 is really just Eclipse with a few add-ons.  It really didn&rsquo;t seem that I would code better because I am using Zend Studio 7.</p>

<p>I gave a review on Dreamweaver not too long ago, so check it out for a overview of my thoughts on Dreamweaver.</p>

<p>Finally, we have Coda.  I&rsquo;ve been using Coda since I&rsquo;ve first got the Mac.  A friend turned me on to it, and I&rsquo;ve been in love with it ever since.  I bought it when it went on sale for $49, although it would have been worth it at the full $100.  Coda is not a WYSIWIG editor like Dreamweaver, it is more of an advanced text editor.  But it has some very nifty built in features that make it rock.  It has a built in site manager that automagically uploads as I save to the configured server.  I can use ftp and also ssh in with a shell interface.  It has all the things that one needs, right there so handy to use.</p>

<p>How you design your web-sites is a very personal thing.  I prefer to use Coda for most everything, and I use Netbeans whenever I need a more powerful ide experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Well, I got a few great things done the past two days.  First I managed to get the last of my sites (this one!) switched from Go Daddy to Dreamhost.  Go Daddy is a great server and a great hosting company, but they placed far to many flash/cool/bandwidth hogs on there main pages and in the control panel.  Doing anything took ten+ minutes.  Dreamhost has a much simpler but equally powerfull interface that I like a lot better.</p>

<p>The second thing that I did was put my php tutorials on their own site.  So now you can go to php.weatheredwatcher.com to see the latest tutorials.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I started to contribute reviews to a friends project titled <a href="http://www.twohourstosuck.com">http://www.twohourstosuck.com</a></p>

<p>I did a review of the newest Harry Potter film.</p>

<p>Well, thats about all for now.  I&rsquo;m working on the next entry in my php tutorial and I&rsquo;ll keep all updated on it&rsquo;s progress!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I remember the first time that I ever used Dreamweaver.  It was way back in the late 90&rsquo;s and it was a total waste of my time.  I had free solutions that gave me just the same functionality, so why?  I used Dreamweaver again when MX came out.  I actually made a lot of great little webpages with it, the only problem was the damn extra mark-up that Macromedia insisted on placing everywhere!  It was almost easier to hand code than to go back and clean things up.  Then, in 2006 I used Dreamweaver from CS2 to make a site for a local Russian language school.  Well, I was originally hired to teach them how to do it, but once it proved fruitless, they hired me to do the entire site.  I tried to make a great design in Dreamweaver, but later I recreated the site totally outside of Dreamweaver and coded it in php.</p>

<p>I totally switched to Linux only not too long after this, and so no Dreamweaver. I used a lot of opensource tools, finally settling on Netbeans as my primary IDE.  Since I am now on a Mac, I decided to give Dreamweaver CS4 a spin to see how it is.  I must say, although I doubt I&rsquo;ll totally abandon Panic!&rsquo;s Coda for my main web-developing on the Mac, I am very impressed with what&rsquo;s happened to Dreamweaver since Adobe took over.  First of all, it now totally incorporates CSS to make creating great sites easy.  Also, the code completion for html tags is one of the features that I have loved in Dreamweaver for a little while.  The best part: No one cumbersome code that has to be removed.  The html is almost perfectly clean (they include some comments that I&rsquo;d rather do without, but anyway&hellip;) All in all, I enjoyed making a quick little site in Dreamweaver.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Let&rsquo;s take a little break from the MVC concept and look at a simple but effective PHP mailer.  Like the PHP framework, I wrote this mailer from scratch just to show how easy it is to code pure PHP applications.</p>

<p>Lets first look at a bit of PHP &ldquo;magic.&rdquo;</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_POST['Submit'])){
    send_mail($_POST['subject'], $_POST['message'], $_POST['header']);
}
 else {
    show_form();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, time to break it down.</p>

<pre><code>if (isset($_POST['Submit']))
</code></pre>

<p>This checks the post to see if a submit button was pressed.  If so, it will carry out the code:</p>

<pre><code>send_mail("me@mysite.com", $_POST['subject'], $_POST['message'], $_POST['header']);
</code></pre>

<p>If there was no submit, because the page has just been loaded or an error occured, the following code is ran:</p>

<pre><code>show_form();
</code></pre>

<p>The remainder of the program is contained in two functions, both of which we have already referred to.  The first function is simple enough. It contains a single echo statement that creates the html code for a form.</p>

<p>The second function, sends the mail.</p>

<pre><code>function send_mail($subject, $message, $header){
    $to = "myemail@mysite.com";
    mail($to, $subject, $message, $header);
    echo("Thank you for sending me an email....I'll get back to you as soon as I can");
}
</code></pre>

<p>We could convert the POSTS to variables before we use them.</p>

<pre><code>$subject = $_POST['subject'];
$message = $_POST['message'];
$header = $_POST['header'];
</code></pre>

<p>This allows us to make some modifications to the header.</p>

<pre><code>from = "From:".$header;
</code></pre>

<p>This is of course is a very simple implementation of the PHP mail function.  You can find a great deal more information on the PHP website.  Stay tuned for our next installment.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    In this post we will talk about the requirements of having two views of the same data in PHP.  First of all, we must do a little bit of modification of our controller</p>

<pre><code>$id = $_GET['id'];
$view = $_GET['view'];

if (!isset($id)){

    $id = "home";

}

include($id.'.php');
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, we added a single line to this code:     $view = $_GET[&lsquo;view&rsquo;];</p>

<p>This allows us to specify what page view we are going to use at this moment.</p>

<p>It would be passed to the url like this: <a href="http://weatheredwatcher.com/ccd_framework/?id=home&amp;view=user">http://weatheredwatcher.com/ccd_framework/?id=home&amp;view=user</a></p>

<p>Of course, we are not done.  There is more code that is needed to make this work.</p>

<p>For staters, we divide the page into two functions.  One function contains the code for the user view and the other contains the code for the edit view.  The switch is made via the URL and is controlled like this:</p>

<pre><code>$page_id ='home';  //this is where you can set exactly what this page is.
$view = $_GET['view'];  //this pulls the view from the URL

     if($view == 'user'){  //here we check if this view is set to user

        user($page_id);
     }
     else{
         if($view == 'edit'){  //here will check if this view is set to edit

             edit($page_id);
     }
    else {  //this final else creates a catch-all for any errors that might exist



         error_page();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, three functions must be defined.  A user function, an edit function and an error_page function</p>

<p>Next time we will go over the code needed to add database dynamics to this code.  That is, we will store the content of the page in a datasource and we will show how to both display and edit this data using our views.</p>
