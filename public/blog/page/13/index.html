  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    My friend Ian made mention of having joined a site called gdgt that helps you list all the gadgets that you own.  And, since the guy who dies with the most toys wins, I decided to also sign up for an account (dduggins).</p>

<p>While I was adding gadgets to my account, I came across a very, very sad individual:</p>

<p><img src="http://weatheredwatcher.files.wordpress.com/2009/09/media_httpimgskitchco_ibfsh-scaled500.jpg" alt="windoze" /></p>

<p>Here is a guy who openly admits to wanting Vista!  Redmond, go find this guy and make a commercial with him!  Maybe bring Seinfield back&hellip;or better yet, lets have this guy do the robot with Bill!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    It dawned on the a while back that using google reader to view all the blogs and other things that interest me online, I was inadvertently sterilizing the web.  I don&rsquo;t see the changes that people make to their websites.   I just read the content.  It is, ultimately a very self-centered act.  We are saying that only the content interests us, not the individuals artistry.  As a web-developer, I have to ask myself if I want others to sterilize my site in the same way.  I have spent a lot of effort on my site. (I just today made some changes to my logo and stuff&hellip;) Both the main site and the theme that my WordPress blog uses.  I also know a lot of sites that are great.  My friend Ian has a <a href="http://www.iangreulichonline.com">great blog</a>.  So is the blog <a href="http://www.noone.org/blog">Blogging is Futile</a>.  One of the blogs I read regularly (a relative term based on updates!) <a href="http://amayita.livejournal.com">Amaya&rsquo;s &ldquo;If I Can&rsquo;t Dance to It It&rsquo;s Not My Revolution&rdquo;</a> has changed at least twice since I&rsquo;ve been reading..and I don&rsquo;t even know when the last change took place!  Another awesome blog site is Andreas Gohr&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.splitbrain.org">splitbrain.org</a></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like google reader, and it has been a very useful tool, just don&rsquo;t forget to check out the sites of your friends from time to time!!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    Okay, I&rsquo;m back!  After nearly a month out of the workforce, I am currently back at the old grindstone.  I am working on a contract with The State Media Company.  It&rsquo;s great to be back at coding again professionally!  Anyway, I got two tid bits to share with all.  The first involves sessions and the second headers.  The app that I am developing (can&rsquo;t get too much into it right now but I&rsquo;ll re-work some of the code for here laters) uses a lot of session work.  You MUST load the session before you do ANYTHING else.  Don&rsquo;t do it, it won&rsquo;t work!  About headers&hellip;&hellip;this is some cool stuff.  I use the code:</p>

<pre><code>header("refresh: $sec, $url);
</code></pre>

<p>to reload a page after the form is validated.  Here is the catch: any program output and the header will not load.</p>

<pre><code>echo("Form didn't Validate");
header("refresh: $sec, $url);
</code></pre>

<p>This code above will result in epic fail.</p>

<p>Another thing that I learned: I really needed to be using Netbeans for this.  My code was working yesterday, today not.  I had made changes to the code and had I been able to use internal versioning of Netbeans, I wouldn&rsquo;t have banged (too much) against the desk!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    I really can&rsquo;t believe this one.  No, I REALLY can&rsquo;t believe this one.  I just got an email that appears to be offering my a job.  The job in question would require me to have access to a company credit card and they want me to submit a credit application before I can be considered for the job.  What are the red flags?</p>

<p>1) The name in the from line is Bethany and the email address is some wacko confab under gmail. And yet it is signed Richard Bennet.</p>

<p>2) The URL for the credit check is also really wonky.  And, to make it worse, they didn&rsquo;t even try to hide the facts that the url is ridiculous!!</p>

<p>Are people this stupid, really.</p>

<p>Trying to post a pic of the email, but my current connection to the interwebs is really wonky (I&rsquo;m at Tech) so check back later to see the pic</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>\n    It&rsquo;s kind of funny.  I&rsquo;ve bought tons of stuff on craigslist.  From cell phones, to computers.  Even furniture. Half the stuff in our house we&rsquo;ve bought on craigslist.  I&rsquo;ve put stuff up for sale on craigslist as well.  The only responses that I&rsquo;ve ever got were from scammers.  I put up a computer.  Sure enough, some lady offers me $100 more than what I was asking for, because she wanted it sent to her special &ldquo;international shipping&rdquo; to Virginia.  And she wanted to pay with eBay.  I said only via check with ID faxed to me.  She insisted on eBay.  I said no dice.  I&rsquo;ve put a timeshare up for rent on craigslist.  Some guy in England wanted to rent it for a week and send the funds to me via a cashiers check that his company was giving him for his vacation.  Once again, no dice.  I thought nothing though of offering my services as a PC Reapair Tech on craigslist.  Come on.  I fix computer.  Then, I got the following email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi,
I saw your email on craigslist and i was hoping if you could help me
repair and install some applications on 15(fifteen)computers, kindly
get back to me if you will be available so i could provide you with
more details on what will be done on them, i will await your swift
response if you will be available,Thank you
Wilfort</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a possible situation.  But the language of the email made the cynic in me very skeptical.  I answered, waiting for the scam.  Sure enough, a few hours later I got this email back from him:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hello,
Thank you for your reply, i have 15 (fifteen) HP computer(Intel Pentium IV) which broke down and i will need you to work on them</p>

<p>   Below are the things needed to be done one on each laptops:</p>

<p>1 Format Hard Drive
2 Microsoft Office Package
3 Install Win Xp with Service Pack 2
4 AVG Virus Software (Free Lifetime Updates)
5 Laptop Cleaning of the keyboard, screen and other case.
6 Adobe Acrobat
7 Diagnostics of the entire system after to check hard, CD Rom,floppy, etc.</p>

<p>   kindly let me know how much it will cost me for the service of all the computers, i have a shipping agent that will be shipping them down to you for the repair along with all the software necessary and after you done with the repair and installation the same shipping agent will be picking them up, the mode of payment is by a US certified check mailed and address to you from my company,I should have make this a phone order but  i am presently on tourism in a remote area in East Anglia and my phone is presently not on roam and also hard to get to a phohe boot around here.let me know if this is ok by you so we may proceed, i will await your quick response. Thank you
Wilfort</p></blockquote>

<p>This is just screaming: &ldquo;I think your a dumb idiot who will take my bait.&rdquo;  Did this guy read my ad?  Did he follow the link to my website and see my history and qualifications?  This is getting ridiculous.  The sad part is that people have to fall for this shit or it would not be continuing.</p>
