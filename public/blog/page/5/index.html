  <div class="entry-content"><p> So, as I was putting my daughter to bed tonight, I saw that she had two of my Doctor Who comics on her night stand(#1 and #2).  For those who do not know, the comic is based on the 10th Doctor.  I told  her if she liked Dr Who, when she got a little bit older we could watch it together. She said to me: &ldquo;Papa, you can keep that old curly man. These are mine!&rdquo;\nFor reference, she is referring to the fourth Doctor who she saw in flashbacks in later comics.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, a few days ago I downloaded the Alpha of TextMate 2.  I must say that it is a nice little package.  Perhaps one of the most notable changes is that of the project drawer being replaced by a file browser.  Although I do miss the ability to load a specific project, I do find that the file browser makes up for it in a lot of ways.  Of course, all my bundles and themes transfered right over and that is nice.  As I use TM for my everyday coding, there are some features that I am currently unaware of.  I hope to be able to sit back and visit some of the other new features and the improvments!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve written a lot of posts about ide&rsquo;s over the years.  Since I am using codeigniter, I did a brief look around to see if there was a good ide for coding CI.  What I found was that a good MVC (like CI or Ruby) really negates the need for an ide.  A really good programmer&rsquo;s text editor works just fine.  I use TextMate.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, here we are!  I&rsquo;ve noticed that with all the transferring things back and forth between blog systems has really done a little number on my entries!  A lot of the source code is gone..=/\nSo, here I am starting a brand new blog.  I have totally rewritten everything (again!) in Codeigniter.  I decided a while ago to basically accept the fact that I am a php developer and just leave it at that.  So, I have found a great MVC framework to work with, as well as an awesome platform to run everything on.  I will be trying to get my older blog entries placed here on this blog, but for the time being, you can take a peek at them on my posterous site (that is certainly the best place to view them) weatheredwatcher.posterous.com.
 In other news, the start up that I have been working on has had a few issues (mainly health issues on my part!) but is back on track to launch very soon.  I have also merged my consultancy with another group and starting January first, we will be really going after high end clients.My role is one of leadership and mainly I will be project managing rather then actually coding.  Hopfully this will allow me time to work more on some person projects as well as be a bit more active in the OSS community.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the coolest tricks that you can do with Apache (ok, so not the coolest but certainly one of the most useful!!) is setting up VirtualHost.  VirtualHost allows you to host many different domains on a single IP address.  As complicated as it is to setup on a real web server, it is even more so on a development machine that doesn&rsquo;t have an IP address or domain registered to a DNS.</p>

<p>In order to set VHosts up on a server, you must:</p>

<pre><code>*Activate Virtual Hosts
*Add your Virtual Hosts File
*Reboot Apache
</code></pre>

<p>Steps 1 and 2 require some editing of the httpd.conf file and a vhosts file.  With that being said, if you want to do this on your local
dev machine, you need to add another step: Add the VirtualHost to the hosts file.  Once you make sure that VirtualHosts are activated
the rest of the code involved is something like this:</p>

<p>httpd_vhost.conf:</p>

<pre><code> NameVirtualHost *:80

 &lt;Directory "*/path/to/site/"&gt;
 Allow From All
 AllowOverride All
 &lt;/Directory&gt;

 &lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt; 

     ServerName "sitename"
     DocumentRoot "/path/to/site"
 &lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>hosts:</p>

<pre><code> 127.0.0.1  sitename
</code></pre>

<p>  And you will have to do these two things for each and every site that you want to use with VirtualHost.  Fear not, there is another
way!  I found an app called VirtualHostX that takes care of everything for you.  It costs.  It costs a little bit more than I would want to spend
for taking care of these two tasks for me.  But it is a helpful app none-the-less. Get it here</p>

<p>In addition to this, if you also install PassengerPhusion, your rails apps will also run without you having to use web-brick!</p>

<p>With all of this talk, I have made the decision that the very first cross-platform app that I intend to build for my new software house
will be one that does just this.  I will write it first in Objective C and then port it to Linux and then in C# for Windows. (I hope that I can port
the objective c code straight into Linux&hellip;but if not I can use C# for both Linux and Windows) So stay tuned for the free beta application!!</p>
