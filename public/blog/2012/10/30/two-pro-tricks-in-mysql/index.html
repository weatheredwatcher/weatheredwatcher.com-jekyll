<p>Chances are you use some form of gui when you interact with MySQL.  Imaright?  I don&rsquo;t.  I prefer to use the command line tools for pretty much everything that I do.  MySQL is no exceptions.  That being said, these two tricks are very helpful, even if you normally use a gui&hellip;in fact, the second trick will work in the gui&rsquo;s as well, &lsquo;cause it is really just some really cool sql.\n The first thing that we are looking at is how we end a sql statement. Typically, you use the &rsquo;;&lsquo; to end your statements like this:</p>

<pre><code>SELECT * FROM table WHERE type="device";
</code></pre>

<p>A pro trick is to use &ldquo;\G&rdquo; like this:</p>

<pre><code>DESCRIBE table\G
</code></pre>

<p>So what is the difference?  Well, &ldquo;\G&rdquo; gives a much easier to read print out of the data then the traditional tabular form.</p>

<pre><code>mysql&gt; select * from cms_phone_features where entry_id=4766\G 
*************************** 1. row *************************** 
entry_id: 4766
  row_id: 18973
  row_order: 0
  style: Touch Screen
  keyboard: Virtual
  camera_front: 1.3-megapixel
  camera_rear: 3.2-megapixel
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
</code></pre>

<p> The second trick that we are going to show today is some cool sql.  So here is the scenario:  You are dealing with a very large database with a massive amount of tables.  Now, all you really want to deal with are a subset of these tables.  They all happen to be prefixed &lsquo;ds_&rsquo;.  So how can we list just these tables?</p>

<pre><code>show tables like 'ds%'\G
</code></pre>

<p>The &lsquo;like&rsquo; term will list tables like whatever string you follow with.  The string must be in &lsquo;&rsquo; and the % is a wildcard that matches anything.</p>

<p> Not so bad huh?  As I am trying to strengthen my dba chops, you will be seeing database specific entries mixed in with my programming entries.</p>
