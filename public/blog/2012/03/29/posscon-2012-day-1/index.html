<p>Well, I am not going to sleep until I blog about POSSCON.  It really started yesterday evening with the Engine Yard Beer Social.  That was a ton of fun! Then today we had a blast.  A bunch of great talks.  Dave Stokes gave a great talk about some of the new stuff to expect in the next version of MySQL&hellip;it&rsquo;s exciting.  Also, great talks from the president of SugarCRM, Mad Dog, and others.  It was a great start.  And of course then end of the day was the Git Hub Drink UP.  Wow!!  What a crowd!!  Certainly the biggest POSSCON ever!!</p>
