<p>Well, Thursday was the closing day of POSSCON.  What can I say?  It was awesome sauce!  Great speakers, good times.  Scott McNeely&rsquo;s talk was good and full of perspective.  Don&rsquo;t agree with him on two topics: php and software patents&hellip;but I am more of a NGO type (if you were there, you&rsquo;ll get it!)\nThe BOF Lunch was good times too.  We had some good interest in the PHP users group.<br/>
Bottom line: Can&rsquo;t wait until next year!</p>
