<p>\n    I am a google fan.  When I see something new in the labs, I gotta give it a try.  I&rsquo;ve just given Fast Flip and speedy spin and I have to say that I am impressed with the potential.</p>

<p>The concept seems to be to give a rss newsreader a more &ldquo;paper&rdquo; feel.  A lot like reading a magazine online.  I like how the content is listed on the page.  An arrow lets you view more content to the right of the screen.</p>

<p>The text of the site is very well rendered, keeping the feel of the original site.  Also, a little pop-up on the side lets you quickly navigate farther down.</p>

<p>The bottom line:  This goes right along with one of my previous posts on Google Reader.  I would love to see the ability to add feeds for my favorite sites to this.  In fact, total customization would be preferred.  This way, I could have the convenience of a newsreader and still see the sites that I am following in a visual way.</p>
