<p>\n    It dawned on the a while back that using google reader to view all the blogs and other things that interest me online, I was inadvertently sterilizing the web.  I don&rsquo;t see the changes that people make to their websites.   I just read the content.  It is, ultimately a very self-centered act.  We are saying that only the content interests us, not the individuals artistry.  As a web-developer, I have to ask myself if I want others to sterilize my site in the same way.  I have spent a lot of effort on my site. (I just today made some changes to my logo and stuff&hellip;) Both the main site and the theme that my WordPress blog uses.  I also know a lot of sites that are great.  My friend Ian has a <a href="http://www.iangreulichonline.com">great blog</a>.  So is the blog <a href="http://www.noone.org/blog">Blogging is Futile</a>.  One of the blogs I read regularly (a relative term based on updates!) <a href="http://amayita.livejournal.com">Amaya&rsquo;s &ldquo;If I Can&rsquo;t Dance to It It&rsquo;s Not My Revolution&rdquo;</a> has changed at least twice since I&rsquo;ve been reading..and I don&rsquo;t even know when the last change took place!  Another awesome blog site is Andreas Gohr&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.splitbrain.org">splitbrain.org</a></p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I like google reader, and it has been a very useful tool, just don&rsquo;t forget to check out the sites of your friends from time to time!!</p>
