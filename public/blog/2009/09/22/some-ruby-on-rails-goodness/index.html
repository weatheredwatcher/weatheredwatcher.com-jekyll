<p>\n    Well, it finally here!  I live in a house that has connections to the internet!  So lack of knowledge and resources can not stop me in mastering Ruby on Rails.  Every project that I ever started, I would hit this wall.  A wall were I would go &ldquo;Damnit!  I could do this in php in about half the time!&rdquo;  It was mainly just a lack of internet and the wonderful resources that it provides.  So now, the lack is gone and I can go boldly forward!!</p>

<p>For starters, I mainly use Coda for Rails development.  I also installed and set up a local git repository.  Then, after a little deployment mishaps earlier today, I decided to give heroku a try.  They offer free webspace for a basic site, so I took them up on the offer.  It&rsquo;s so awesome.  Okay, so it took me two hours and a blood sacrifice to get it all set up initially, but once I had it all up, it&rsquo;s awesome.  I&rsquo;m coding and testing and deploying so fast it&rsquo;s crazy!!  So shortly I hope to have a few good working sites up in Rails!</p>
