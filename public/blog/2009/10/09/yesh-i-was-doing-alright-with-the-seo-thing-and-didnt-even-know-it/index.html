<p>\n    I&rsquo;ve doing some looking into my seo&#8217;ness the past couple of days.  I looked at the Top Search Queries and found out that the phrase &ldquo;mac ide&rdquo; returned my site in the top 12.  I gave it a try, and just look at the results!!</p>

<p>Look at that!  If anyone searches for &ldquo;mac ide&rdquo; my blog post on mac ide&rsquo;s is on the bottom of page two!!!  Not too shabby.  Now it&rsquo;s time to see if we can&rsquo;t make it any better</p>
