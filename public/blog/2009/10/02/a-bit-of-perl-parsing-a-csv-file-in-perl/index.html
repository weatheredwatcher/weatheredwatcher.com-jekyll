<p>\n    I&rsquo;ve been working on a solution that takes uploaded CSV files and parses them to process the data (in my case ultimately it will live in a database)  Here is some sample code that I put together in my sand-box that takes care of parsing the data in to an array.  <em>DISCLAIMER</em> This is not a newbie tutorial.  If you don&rsquo;t already understand perl and oo programming, you might be a little bit lost.  This solution requires the Text::CSV module from CPAN (Right here)</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/perl
# Sandbox application for testing perl script CSV parse

use strict;
use warnings;
use Text::CSV

my $csv = Text::CSV-&gt;new();

open (CSV, ") {
                next if ($. == 1); 
                if ($csv-&gt;parse($_)) {
                    my @columns = $csv-&gt;fields();
                    print "tBusiness Name: $columns[0]ntContact: $columns[1]ntMessage: $columns[11]nn";
                    print "t----------------------------nn";
            } else {
                    my $err = $csv-&gt;error_input;
                    print "Failed to parse line: $err";
            }



    }

    close CSV;
    exit;
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, lets break this down a bit.  The first thing that we do (after loading all the mods) is to create a new csv object.</p>

<pre><code>my $csv = Text::CSV-&gt;new();
</code></pre>

<p>Then the while() line iterates through the file.</p>

<p>This code pareses and displays the data:</p>

<pre><code>if ($csv-&gt;parse($_)) {
        my @columns = $csv-&gt;fields();
        print "tBusiness Name: $columns[0]ntContact: $columns[1]ntMessage: $columns[11]nn";
        print "t----------------------------nn";
</code></pre>

<p>The thing that you need to keep in mind for later is that all the data is stored in an array called @columns.  We can access the data by specifying which array item to use.  Like most languages, we use [n] to tell which item to use.</p>

<p>Next time I will write about how you can take this parsed data and insert it into a database.</p>
