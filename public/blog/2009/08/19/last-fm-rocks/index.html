<p>\n    I&rsquo;ve been scrobbling tracks to last.fm for years now.  I just recently listened to the last.fm recommends using the iPhone app.  It&rsquo;s been solid for every track.  I&rsquo;ve enjoyed everything.  It&rsquo;s a truly remarkable service when a computer can figure out exactly what kind of music you like!!</p>
