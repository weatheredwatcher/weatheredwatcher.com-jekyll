<p>\n    I really can&rsquo;t believe this one.  No, I REALLY can&rsquo;t believe this one.  I just got an email that appears to be offering my a job.  The job in question would require me to have access to a company credit card and they want me to submit a credit application before I can be considered for the job.  What are the red flags?</p>

<p>1) The name in the from line is Bethany and the email address is some wacko confab under gmail. And yet it is signed Richard Bennet.</p>

<p>2) The URL for the credit check is also really wonky.  And, to make it worse, they didn&rsquo;t even try to hide the facts that the url is ridiculous!!</p>

<p>Are people this stupid, really.</p>

<p>Trying to post a pic of the email, but my current connection to the interwebs is really wonky (I&rsquo;m at Tech) so check back later to see the pic</p>
