<p>\n    I threw up a quick site from iWeb for my daughter not too long ago and I&rsquo;ve decided to create a custom site for her all in Ruby on Rails.  This is mainly to test out rails a bit more so I can form a decent opinion of it vs. php.  Today, I also decided to see how Textmate  does as a Rails coder vs. Coda (which I use mostly now).  I recently ran an update of rails on the mac and when I started to configure the site by typing rails foto_devochka, all I got was a string of errors.  I tried upgrading everything&hellip;no luck.  I finally found a post on a Rails site that seemed to address my issue.  They recommended:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem update
sudo gem update --system
sudo gem install rails
</code></pre>

<p>After this completed, rails worked again.  I created the app and tried to view it in the browser.  No dice.  I checked the dbase configuration.  Looked good.  Checked the server output.  It was complaining about sqlite.  Sqlite ships with Mac, so I&rsquo;ve never installed it before, but apparently, when I reinstalled rails, it lost all the gems. So:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
</code></pre>

<p>Did the trick.</p>

<p>With that little technical garbage out of the way, here is my setup for Textmate.  I&rsquo;m using Textmate in one space for development, a terminal in another space for server/console and I have safari loaded in a third space for testing.  I can easily switch between them using key-strokes, or clicking on the right icon in the dock.  The only issue that I can see is the one of ftp&#8217;ing stuff.  In Coda it is automatic.  I&rsquo;ll need yet another program to upload files with this set-up.</p>

<p>I admit, I still use Mac&rsquo;s terminal with Coda.  I also use Safari for previewing.  So I&rsquo;m not really using Coda to it&rsquo;s &ldquo;full&rdquo; potential here.  I do use Coda to take a peek at my views, and I have used it for terminal stuff, but it is really just as easy to use the bash shell that comes natively with Mac.  It&rsquo;s that damn ftp feature that I love so much.  I seriously doubt that I&rsquo;ll ever use Textmate for full blown Rails or php development.  It&rsquo;ll make a great text editor though.  It really is the culmination of emacs.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get back to the site, shall we.  This is not my first site in Rails, so I quickly setup a framework and modify the routes.rb file.  Soon, my pages are working, just need a template now for the main pages.</p>

<p>Here are the pages that I&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<pre><code>script/generate controller Site index about gallery about
</code></pre>

<p>Then I create a site layout file.  IT contains the links.  A great little timesaver in rails is the</p>

<pre><code>link_to_unless_current
</code></pre>

<p>This creates the link, but will not link to it if is the current page.  Makes for a bit cleaner page.  I don&rsquo;t use it everywhere, but it&rsquo;s a good thought.</p>

<p>Now I just need some ajax goodies, so I&rsquo;ll load a bunch of javascript libraries that I&rsquo;ll need:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "prototype.js" %&gt;
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "scriptaculous.js?load=effects,builder" %&gt;
&lt;%= javascript_include_tag "lightbox.js" %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Wow, it&rsquo;s looking good and in no time!   I do like the flow but now that I&rsquo;ve got a little something to upload, I know I&rsquo;ll start missing Coda.  Okay, so I&rsquo;m also going to miss Coda when it comes to css.  Coda has spoiled me with it&rsquo;s css editor.</p>

<p>Well, that is it for now.  I&rsquo;ll be finishing up this site (in Coda) and then posting it to the web.  I&rsquo;ll post a link when it&rsquo;s fully functioning</p>
