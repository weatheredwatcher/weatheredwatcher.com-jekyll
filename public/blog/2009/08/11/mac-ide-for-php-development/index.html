<p>\n    I&rsquo;ve been trying out a lot of IDE&rsquo;s lately.  I&rsquo;ve decided to post a run down of them and blog about my personal preferences.  I&rsquo;ve used the following IDE&rsquo;s</p>

<p><em>Netbeans
</em>Eclipse
<em>Coda
</em>Dreamweaver
<em>Aptana (Eclipse based)
</em>Zend Studio 7 (Eclipse based)</p>

<p>For starters, I&rsquo;ve used Netbeans for a very long time.  I am very familiar with it&rsquo;s features and know my way way around very well.  It has very good support for php and the even has a great php community around it.  I really enjoy they way Netbeans handles code completion and also it has a great snippet functionality built in.  I particularly enjoy the ability to search entire projects for a string.  It makes finding functions in unfamiliar frameworks a piece of cake.</p>

<p>Then there is Eclipse.  I&rsquo;m going to start with Eclipse and then fill in the other two Eclipse based ide&rsquo;s afterwards.  I find Eclipse to be slow. It is also a rather bulky interface.  Maybe, you might say I&rsquo;d like it better if I had used it before Netbeans&hellip;.no&hellip;I actually used Eclipse long before I knew of Netbeans.  It&rsquo;s always been a bit clunky for me.  All in all, it has allot of the same features of Netbeans, and for most people, I&rsquo;m sure it really is just a matter of taste.</p>

<p>I used Aptana for a little bit on a project a while ago and it appears to be a fairly solid little ide.  It comes pre-loaded with all the Eclipse plugins that you need to code web 2.0.  It has loads of templates and javascript snippets to help you along.  It just is still Eclipse.</p>

<p>I most recently decided to give Zend Studio 7 a run around the block.  Once again, Zend builds on the Eclipse platform, but unlike Aptana, which has a fairly refreshed interface, Zend 7 is really just Eclipse with a few add-ons.  It really didn&rsquo;t seem that I would code better because I am using Zend Studio 7.</p>

<p>I gave a review on Dreamweaver not too long ago, so check it out for a overview of my thoughts on Dreamweaver.</p>

<p>Finally, we have Coda.  I&rsquo;ve been using Coda since I&rsquo;ve first got the Mac.  A friend turned me on to it, and I&rsquo;ve been in love with it ever since.  I bought it when it went on sale for $49, although it would have been worth it at the full $100.  Coda is not a WYSIWIG editor like Dreamweaver, it is more of an advanced text editor.  But it has some very nifty built in features that make it rock.  It has a built in site manager that automagically uploads as I save to the configured server.  I can use ftp and also ssh in with a shell interface.  It has all the things that one needs, right there so handy to use.</p>

<p>How you design your web-sites is a very personal thing.  I prefer to use Coda for most everything, and I use Netbeans whenever I need a more powerful ide experience.</p>
