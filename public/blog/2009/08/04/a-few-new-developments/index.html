<p>\n    Well, I got a few great things done the past two days.  First I managed to get the last of my sites (this one!) switched from Go Daddy to Dreamhost.  Go Daddy is a great server and a great hosting company, but they placed far to many flash/cool/bandwidth hogs on there main pages and in the control panel.  Doing anything took ten+ minutes.  Dreamhost has a much simpler but equally powerfull interface that I like a lot better.</p>

<p>The second thing that I did was put my php tutorials on their own site.  So now you can go to php.weatheredwatcher.com to see the latest tutorials.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, and I started to contribute reviews to a friends project titled <a href="http://www.twohourstosuck.com">http://www.twohourstosuck.com</a></p>

<p>I did a review of the newest Harry Potter film.</p>

<p>Well, thats about all for now.  I&rsquo;m working on the next entry in my php tutorial and I&rsquo;ll keep all updated on it&rsquo;s progress!</p>
