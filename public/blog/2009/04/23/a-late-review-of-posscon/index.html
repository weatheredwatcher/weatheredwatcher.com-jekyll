<p>Sorry for the late review&hellip;I&rsquo;ve been very busy.  All and all it was a good time with the guys.  Some of the talks were good, others not so much.  I thought that the Developer&rsquo;s track was not as good as it could have been.  They really only talked about three highly experimental open-source software languages.  The only talk that was really geared towards developing&hellip;language specific&hellip;.was a talk on Open Source tools for C#&hellip;..C# WTF!!  When he started talking about C# and how it now implements MVC&hellip;I left.  MVC is a fairly old and tried and true development frameworks that has been used by Java and other programming languages for years&hellip;.It&rsquo;s recently been adopted by web-developers and is availible in Ruby on Rails, PHP and pretty much anything else&hellip;.Microsoft is, as always, coming to the party a bit late here.  For a great review, check out my friend Ian&rsquo;s blog</p>
