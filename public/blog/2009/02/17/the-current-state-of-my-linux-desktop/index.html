<p>\n    I am currently using a mixed Ubuntu/Debian system.  I have always liked the apt system, and Debian has been the distro that I have used the most, but I&rsquo;ve always had two major beefs with them. </p>

<p>1) I don&rsquo;t like how loooong it takes for them to catch up&hellip;Come on, Lenny was released on Valentines Day and they are still using Gnome 2.22 and Offfice 2.2!!  </p>

<p>2) They can be just a bit to fanatical at times&hellip;Like the whole Firefox thing&hellip;..</p>

<p> </p>

<p>I also initially had a few beefs with Ubuntu.</p>

<p>1) I can&rsquo;t stand the names.  Intrepid Ibex? Come on now&hellip;.</p>

<p>2) They seemed initially to be creating a massive fork from Debian that I didn&rsquo;t like.  We already have three major RPM standards&hellip;.could we keep a deb a deb for crying out loud.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Although I still am not so fond of the naming conventions, Ubuntu seems to be keeping to the standard debs some what.  I;ve not yet found a deb I couldn&rsquo;t install, be it either for Debian or Ubuntu, and when I recently install Debian Etch, I found most Ubuntu deb would install little or no problem as well.</p>

<p>I choose Ubuntu as my base mainly for the kernel, gnome.  I stil had to install OO from the site to get 3.  I also get Firefox 3 in Ubuntu and not Iceweasle (don&rsquo;t ask me why it makes a difference, it just does okay.) I also hooked up the unstable/testing debian repos and I&rsquo;ve exponetially increased my installable app base.  So all and all I am very pleased with my system.</p>
