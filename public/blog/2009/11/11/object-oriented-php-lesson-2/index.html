<p>\n    Yesterday we talked about some basics in oo php programming.  To day I am going to show you how to extend a class and also how to be utillity methods (functions) in your class.</p>

<p>Yesterday we created a car class called Car.  To today we will extend that class with a sportsCarClass.  Why, you might ask, do we want to do this?  It&rsquo;s simple.  I might want to create several different types of cars. Maybe I want a SUV car object, or a truck object. All of these objects will have certain properties that are the same (make, model, color, ect)  Why wouldn&rsquo;t I reuse the code that I already have?  I could copy-paste, but that would only serve to make my program a whole lot larger than it needs to be.  So, instead, I&rsquo;ll extend my base class to make other classes.  The one that I&rsquo;ll be demonstrating is the sportsCarClass.  We start out by declaring the class and extending the base class, followed by declaring any variables that this new class will be using.</p>

<pre><code>class sportsCar extends Car  {
    var $engine;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In case you are wondering, this is in the same class file as our original carClass.</p>

<p>Next we will define some setter and getter functions for the sports car class.</p>

<pre><code>function add_engine($type){ 

    $this-&gt;engine = $type;
 }
    function get_engine(){  

     return $this-&gt;engine;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>I don&rsquo;t need to show you how to use this in your driver program.  Give it a go!  You will notice that you can create a new sportsCar and set make, model, color and engine and it will work, even though you don&rsquo;t have any setter functions for make, model or color in your class.  Also, if you try and set the engine type in a Car, it will fail because Car cannot see sportsCar.</p>

<p>At this point, it might be a good time to point out a few items of importance.  Did you notice that in our driver program we call the functions using the class name followed by &ndash;> and the function?  We refer to the variables in our class in the same way, but we use $this instead of the class name.  This is important, because we can also use this to pull variables into other function in our class in this same way.</p>

<p>Lets make a utillity function that will display our object in an easy to read format.</p>

<pre><code>function show_car(){
            echo('Make: '.$this-&gt;make.'');
            echo('Model: '.$this-&gt;model.'');
            echo('Color: '.$this-&gt;color.'');
            echo('Engine: '.$this-&gt;engine.'');
}
</code></pre>

<p>Next time we will use oo programming to do something infinitely more useful.  We will create a mailer class that can be used in a contact form.</p>
