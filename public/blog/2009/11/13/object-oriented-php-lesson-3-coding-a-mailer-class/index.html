<p>\n    Today we are going to create a mailer class that will assist us in emailing site visitors.  Lets start out buy creating the class and the variables we will need.</p>

<pre><code>class Mailer {

}
</code></pre>

<p>Okay, let see.  We will need a sender, a recipient, a subject and a body. Well, if you know anything about email, the sender is set in the header.  So&hellip;</p>

<pre><code>class Mailer {
    var $headers; 
    var $recipient;
    var $subject; 
    var $message;  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now comes the fun part!  Lets build the email!</p>

<p>First we have a from setter:</p>

<pre><code>function from($email, $name){   
     $this-&gt;headers[] = 'From: '.$email.' ';
 }
</code></pre>

<p>What we have done, is we have appended the required format for the Header.  In php the &lsquo;.&rsquo; is what we use to concatenate strings and variable data together.  Also, note that the header is an array.  We could add more than just &ldquo;From&rdquo; to the header if we needed to.</p>

<p>Now we add rest of the functions.</p>

<pre><code>function add_recipient($email){

    $this-&gt;recipient = $email;
 }


 function subject($subject){  

    $this-&gt;subject = $subject;
 }

 function message($message) {

    $this-&gt;message = $message;
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we don&rsquo;t have any getter methods defined.  Although it&rsquo;s a good practice to have them in your class for a program, it would just add extra stuff to a class that&rsquo;s sole purpose in life is to run a contact me page.  Now, if you wanted to use this in a larger site.  Say a cms or a social portal, you would want to add a bunch more functions to it.  That way you could get all of your email functionality out of a single class file.</p>

<p>But for now, this is enough.  Let&rsquo;s create a utillity function to send the mail.</p>

<pre><code>function send()
{  //sends the email

    $headers = "";
        foreach($this-&gt;headers as $header)
        {
           $headers .= $header.';';
        }
        return mail($this-&gt;recipient, $this-&gt;subject, $this-&gt;message, $headers);
 }
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, we add all the header information, then the rest of the data is pulled into the mail function.</p>

<p>And how do we use this?  By now I hope that you understand the layout of my driver files.  So it&rsquo;s your turn.  Create a contact form and use this class to make it work.</p>
